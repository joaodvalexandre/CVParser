### CVParser
Angular Page to parse a CV JSON File format

### What is the purpose of this?
This is to present myself, with a beautiful webpage fully created using Angular 17.

### How to start the project up?
In order to begin the project up, you need to first and foremost, clone the project to a folder of your choosing.
Then, after cloning, start by going into the folder, and typing into the command line:
  ```sh
  npm install 
  ```
Once it finishes installing all the modules, then you can start the project up, by running:
  ```sh
  ng serve
  ```
If you want to open the page after it starts, simply add the command ```--open``` at the end.
